# Multivariate Linear Regression Project

## 1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict a target variable based on multiple predictors using a multivariate linear regression model. 
This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a regression model using multiple features.

## 2. Data Sources
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project comes from cars.csv file
- **Data Structure**: The data contains multiple predictor variables (features) and a target variable.
- **Data Challenges**: Preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## 3. Approach to Solution
- **Methodology**: The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Key tools include Python with libraries such as Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-Learn for regression model training and evaluation.
- **Model Used**: A multivariate linear regression model was applied to identify the relationship between multiple predictors and the target variable.

## 4. Results and Conclusions
- **Results**: The model provided accurate predictions with insights into the significance of each predictor in explaining the target variable.
- **Insights**: The EDA and model coefficients highlighted the strength and direction of relationships between predictors and the target.
- **Conclusion**: This project successfully showcases multivariate linear regression, with further improvements suggested, such as trying regularization techniques or polynomial features for enhanced model performance.
